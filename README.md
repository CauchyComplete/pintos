pintos : undergraduate Operating System course project at Sogang University (서강대학교 운영체제 핀토스 프로젝트)

Since this project was conducted at Sogang University which is in Korea, the documents are written in Korean.

Codes and comments are in English.

Note that my university covers only project 1~3 from the original Stanford pintos project, i.e., project 4: File Systems is not implemented.

Also note that the order of the project is quite different from the original Stanford pintos, which you will notice when you see the documents.

Pintos is definitely a terribly hard task for undergraduates but it really helps you improve.

Good luck with your pintos! :D
